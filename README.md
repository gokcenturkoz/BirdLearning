## Weekly Progress Summary (18.11.2019) 

• Decided and start to work about the deep learning algorithm
• Updated the web site and GitHub account
• Added System Requirements
• Installed libraries (Pygame and Tensorflow)
• Started project via PyCharm. (Front-end)

## System Requirements:

## 1)Functional Requirements
The bird should play the game (Flappy Bird) itself. But the bird don't know how to play this game before this project hasn't a learning algorithm. By using this algorithm, the bird will learn this game and it will play without losing. 

## 2)Non-functional Requirements 

--> Performance should be well because this project needs good system requirements. Such as RAM, proccessor.. Otherwise, bird learns slowly. 

--> Scalability This requirements depend on bird's learning. Also system performance effects it.

--> Security This project doesn't need a high security because we don't need to keep any personal information.

--> Maintainability There is no need to maintain because the project doesn't need a change.

--> Usability Via this project can use on other games.  

--> Availability Self learning is available all gaming platforms.

## Tasking:

Front-end --> Hümeyra BİLGİ

Back-end --> Oğuzhan SOLAK

Machine Learning --> Gökçen TÜRKÖZ, Hasan DİNÇKURT, Yasin Tarık SUYABATMAZ
